1.- What is suerte
===============================


======================
2.- How to install it
======================

If you are reading it your intention is to build the program
from source. If not, try looking for .deb o .rpm pakages of
the program at <http://weekendworks.wordpress.com/suerte> or,
if available, using your distribution package manager like 
yum or aptitude.
	
	========================
	2.1.- Build from source
	========================

	Before building suerte, check that the following libraries
	are installed in your system. If not, install them using
	your standard packager manager:

	build-essential g++ pkg-config libgtkmm-2.4-dev libmagick++-dev

	When installed, continue with the following steps:

	$ ./autogen.sh (ONLY do that if configure file is not
								 present in suerte directory. It should need
								 autoconf and automake packages)
	$ ./configure (its possible that some advice is printed
								suggesting the installation of some tool
								or package.)
	$ make
	$ make install (execute this as super-user or root user)

	================
	2.2.- Uninstall
	================

	$ make uninstall (execute this as super-user or root user)

=============
3.- Using it
=============

After building and installing it, the application can be launch
with this command-line style:


suerte [OPTION]... 


The following options can be used to modify program behavior:

-v, --version             : Show the program version.

-h, --help                : Show the program help.


====================
4.- Developer notes
====================

If you are trying to improve the project, taking source code
from it or studying how it works, read this section.

It is possible to build a full html, latex and pdf documentation
from the source in folder suerte. To do so, follow this steps:

$ ./configure (its possible that some advice is printed
							suggesting the installation of some tool
							or package.)
$ make html (needs to have doxygen installed)
$ make pdf  (needs to have pdflatex installed)

If done correctly, two folders will be created:

doc/html  :  HTML documentation. See it with 
                your web-browser (firefox, chromium, etc)
								opening suerte/doc/html/index.html.

doc/latex :  latex and pdf documentation. See it with
                your pdfreader (evince, kpdf, etc).

Both documents provide the same content, the reference manual
of the whole application. Class diagrams, parameters explanation
and more is there.
